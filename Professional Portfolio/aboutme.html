        <p class="about-me-text">I'm Gabi Shorr, a senior at the University of Connecticut majoring in Digital Media and Design with a focus on Web/Interactive Media Design. Since a very young age I have had a passion for design and technology. It all started with designing business cards and brochures for my made up companies using the Microsoft suite on the computer my parents had gifted me. From then on I always took every art or technology class available to me which evolved into my passion for design. I've refined my web development skills through coursework and work as my job Student Web Designer at UConn's IT Services. I have had the opportunity to work on many cool project both inside the classroom and out. My senior project (which is located on the home/my work page) is my most loved project. From the wireframing process to the prototyping process to the coding process this project is a showcase of my abilities as well as my creativity. I am very proud of its turnout. I have had the opportunity to learn so many new skills and softwares during the process of this project. It has been the most challenging yet most exhilerating part of this year long project. I am always eagar to learn new things in the ever changing world of technology. Please reach out to me! I would love to chat!  </p>
