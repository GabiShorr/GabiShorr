        <p class="about-me-text">I'm Gabi Shorr, and my journey in design has been a lifelong obsession. Ever since I can remember, I've been captivated by the world of visual aesthetics. My love for design took root when I was gifted a computer at a young age, equipped with the Microsoft Suite. It wasn't long before I discovered my new favorite hobby â€“ designing business cards and brochures for a little business I created.
            As I grew older and had more choices in my classes, my natural gravitation was towards art courses. It was during my time in high school that I stumbled upon the Adobe Suite and instantly fell in love. My high school offered an array of creative classes, including Adobe Illustrator 1 & 2, Photography 1 & 2 (where we delved into Adobe Photoshop), Graphic Design, and Web Design. It was in these classes that my passion for digital design solidified.
            When I entered the University of Connecticut as a Digital Media and Design major, my journey into the world of design accelerated. In my sophomore year, I discovered the Web and Interactive Design concentration, and it became clear that this was the path I wanted to pursue. Serendipitously, I secured a position as a Student Web Designer for Information Technology Services at UConn during the same year.
            In this role, I've had the opportunity to hone my skills in UX/UI design and become proficient in WordPress. As a testament to my coding abilities, I've personally hard-coded this entire website. It's been an incredible journey of growth, and now, as a senior in my program, I'm eager to bring my expertise and passion for web and interactive design to a professional setting.
            I believe in the power of design to shape digital experiences, and I'm excited to contribute my skills and creativity to projects that leave a lasting impact. Thank you for considering me as a potential member of your team.</p>
